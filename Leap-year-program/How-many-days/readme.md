# **Scenario**

Your task is to write and test a function which takes two arguments (a year and a month) and returns the number of days for the given month/year pair (while only February is sensitive to the year value, your function should be universal).

The initial part of the function is ready. Now, convince the function to return None if its arguments don't make sense
