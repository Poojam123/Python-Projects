**Scenario**

Your program must:

#ask the user to enter a word;

#use userWord = userWord.upper() to convert the word entered by the user to upper case; we'll talk about the so-called string methods and the upper() method very soon - don't worry;

#use conditional execution and the continue statement to "eat" the following vowels A, E, I, O, U from the inputted word;

#assign the uneaten letters to the wordWithoutVovels variable and print the variable to the screen.
