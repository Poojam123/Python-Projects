**Scenerio**

Your task is to complete the code in order to evaluate the following expression:

3x^3 - 2x^2 + 3^x - 1

The result should be assigned to y.

Remember that classical algebraic notation likes to omit the multiplication operator - you need to use it explicitly. Note how we change data type to make sure that x is of type float.

Keep your code clean and readable, and test it using the data we've provided, each time assigning it to the x variable (by hardcoding it). Don't be discouraged by any initial failures. Be persistent and inquisitive.
