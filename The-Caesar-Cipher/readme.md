*The first problem we want to show you is called the Caesar cipher - more details here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher
*This cipher was (probably) invented and used by Gaius Julius Caesar and his troops during the Gallic Wars. The idea is rather simple - every letter of the message is replaced by its nearest consequent (A becomes B, B becomes C, and so on). The only exception is Z, which becomes A.
*We've written it using the following assumptions:
   *it accepts Latin letters only (note: the Romans used neither whitespaces nor digits)
   *all letters of the message are in upper case (note: the Romans knew only capitals)
